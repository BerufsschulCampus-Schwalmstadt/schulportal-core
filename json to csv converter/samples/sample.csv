Crenshaw challenges the audience to consider the importance of the &ldquo;frames&rdquo; through which we see-or more aptly, do not see- Black [American] women, the cyclical nature of their struggles, and how systemic social problems impact them as a subset of a targeted group. Students, staff, and faculty are invited to view with Crenshaw&rsquo;s talk together; explore the concept of intersectionality through the lens of contemporary case studies; and consider ways to embody the concept, for our own awareness and, critically, for the humanity and safety of those with whom we are in community.</p>

<p>ABSTRACT:&nbsp;Going to war, having a baby, being spiritually reborn, betraying your lover, emigrating to a new country &mdash; all of these are experiences that can transform you. By transforming you, they change you, and in the process, they restructure the nature and meaning of your life. I&rsquo;ll discuss the nature of transformative experience, and show how exploring its conceptual structure can help us to understand the special and distinctive ways that new experiences can form and change us, and how this relates to how we make life choices, both big and small.</p>

<p>Why do treatises in Early modern Period consider seeing as a form of hunting? How is this metaphor as well as flying itself manifested in images? What are the common points between image practices and the iconic power of Falconry?</p>

<p>In addition to these theoretical and present-day considerations, artists working on Falconry will have a dialogue with a professional Arab falconer and a Bedouin poet, adding a further central point to the workshop namely the connection between theory and practice.</p>

We are writing you as a follow up to our previous communication regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.<br />
The IRS updated the 2018 income tax withholding tables and issued related guidance on January 11th. The new tax withholding tables have been designed to work with the current Form W-4 (Employee&#39;s Withholding Allowance Certificate). The changes in employees&#39; payroll tax withholdings were reflected in paychecks beginning January 31. Please consult your tax advisor with questions about your personal tax situation and how the new federal tax rates impact your with-holding and annual tax obligations. You may also refer to the information published by the IRS at:https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/n1036.pdf.<br />
The IRS has issued guidance that the Form W-4 will be redesigned for tax year 2019 to reflect the suspension of the personal exemption deduction.&nbsp; We will alert you when the new Form W-4 is available so you can update your information for 2019.<br />

Recipients receive a gold tassel that they can wear during Commencement, as well as a personalized certificate.</p>

<p>After almost a year of deliberation, the NYU University Senate, which includes representation from all NYU schools - inluding NYU Abu Dhabi, has decided to modify the selection criteria for the Founder&#39;s Day award. Instead of the previous policy of designating all students who had a 3.5 cumulative GPA or higher, the University will award all students who graduate in the top 40% of their respective schools. This cross-school consistency is an important part of being an NYU global institution. For NYU Abu Dhabi - as for other NYU schools - this will mean that somewhat fewer students will receive this accolade. At the same time, the prestige for those who do is enhanced.<br />

<p>The Writing Partners Program (WPP) is a series of personalized meetings between you and a Writing Instructor in the Writing Center. The program is fully student driven and student centered -- you get to decide what you want to&nbsp;work on over the course of the semester -- papers, essays, presentations, reading skills, creative projects, etc.&nbsp; The possibilities are endless.&nbsp; Your Writing Instructor is there to guide you throughout the semester and serve as a dedicated reading&nbsp;and writing partner.</p>

<p>If you are part of the WPP you will meet at least 6 times with your Writing Instructor over the course of this semester. Your Writing Instructor and you determine when these meetings take place and you determine what you want to work on.&nbsp;</p>
