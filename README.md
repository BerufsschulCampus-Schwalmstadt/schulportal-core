## Problem Identification
Current NYU Abu Dhabi students are suffering. They are missing deadlines, events, and information. But why?  
In today's world, there is an increasing amount of platforms and notifications students must keep track of. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that they will check the Student Portal and Facebook groups within NYU Abu Dhabi on a day to day basis.

## Purpose and Goals
The purpose of this project is to help the NYUAD student community be informed of their surroundings which include deadlines, events, operating campus time changes, and other university-related information.  

Our goal is to create a Facebook Messenger Chatbot that will allow students to get message notifications. This will be done through the scraping of Student Portal using python and BeautifulSoup and NYUAD Facebook Groups using the Facebook API.

## User Stories and Use Cases
- As a user, I want to be able to check the nyuad-spammer chatbot
  - The user should be able to access the chatbot on his/her messenger account.
- As a user, I want to be able to type in keywords to get information on Student Portal or NYUAD Facebook Groups.
  - The user should be able to see the list of keywords he/she can type in to access categories in Student Portal or NYUAD Facebook Groups.
  - The user should be able to recieve information on deadlines and events after typing the keyword.
- As a user, I want to be able to recieve notifications at a certain hour and day.
  - The user should be able to tell the chatbot to remind him/her about an deadline or event at a certain chosen time.
- As a user, I want to be able to snooze notifications.
  - The user should be able to ask the chatbot to hide the notification.
